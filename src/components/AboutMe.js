            I have been developing websites for almost a year. I'm Full-Stack Web Developer. My favourite Web tools are JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Github, GitBush,
             HTML, CSS, MySQL etc

            

           </p>
           <p className="about-para">I create responsive websites that are displayed on all devices desktops and smartphones.

Of course, before I begin developing any webapp, Landing Page or Business Website, I need to have a ready-made project layout (sketch).

And Iâ€™m ready to do this for you, before we start developing your website, we will discuss all the  details of your niche with you, I will conduct a survey of your competitors and make a list of their advantages and weaknesses.

All this is necessary to give your customers something that your competitors do not provide, or to present it too, but better!</p>
